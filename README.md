# Stellar classifier based on star spectrum 

This was one of my first projects testing different classifier algorithms and methods applied to stars. (Sorry it's in Spanish, eventualy I will translate the notebook but I want to keep making things, the rest of the projects will be in English)

It's not perfect and less a explainable model since I just push the spectra data in to the different models, but I learned a lot of things that someone
may have trouble with:

## What have I learned

- Stellar data is kind of hard to get if you don't know where to search; but there is a lot of them just checkout missions you know or email any observatory and almost everyone will help you.

- I learned how to work with FITS files which is a common file when your are working with it.

- Different models need different data; so if anyone is reading this you may have to transform your data in a way that you don't affect the outcome 

## Warnings!!!

Some of the code is commented or in markdown, be aware that if you uncomment that you may crush your computer with a lot of pictures of different spectra.
(I let the code that downloads and checks the fit files for 11 hours non stop and I think I wasn't even close to the end)
